                        the full meaning of jwt is json web token. It is an open standard used
                        to share security information between two parties â€” both client and and server.
                        It's a part of authorization. when a user logged in in a server then the server create a token
                        and send to the particular user for authorization. jwt can be stored in localstorege,cookies ,and other memory in client site. when the user want to send any request to server, the server first confirm that the token is valid or not. if anyhow the token is invalid the user cannot access the server.
                        if the token is valid, the user can get access
